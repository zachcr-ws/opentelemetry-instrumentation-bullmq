# OpenTelemetry Bullmq Instrumentation for Node.js

This module provides automatic tracing instrumentation for [BullMQ][bullmq-web-url].

Compatible with OpenTelemetry JS API and SDK `1.0+`.

## Installation

```bash
npm install --save @workstream/opentelemetry-instrumentation-bullmq
```

### Supported Versions

- `[1.90.1, 2.x, 3.x, 4.x, 5.x]`

It's likely that the instrumentation would support earlier versions of BullMQ, but I haven't tested it.

## Usage

OpenTelemetry Bullmq Instrumentation allows the user to automatically collect trace data from Bullmq jobs and workers and export them to the backend of choice.

To load the instrumentation, specify it in the instrumentations list to `registerInstrumentations`. There is currently no configuration option.

```javascript
const { NodeTracerProvider } = require('@opentelemetry/sdk-trace-node');
const { registerInstrumentations } = require('@opentelemetry/instrumentation');
const { BullMQInstrumentation } = require('@jenniferplusplus/opentelemetry-instrumentation-bullmq');

const provider = new NodeTracerProvider();
provider.register();

registerInstrumentations({
  instrumentations: [
    new BullMQInstrumentation({
        isConsole: true,
        isSetDataInAttribute: true,
        logger: new Logger(),
    }),
  ],
});
```

Contributions are welcome. Feel free to open an issue or submit a PR. I would like to have this package included in opentelemetry-js-contrib at some point. Until then, it lives here.

BullMQ has a hard dependency on Redis, which means that Redis is (for now) a test dependency for the instrumentations. To run the tests, you should have a redis server running on localhost at the default port. If you have docker installed, you can just do `docker-compose up` and be ready to go.
